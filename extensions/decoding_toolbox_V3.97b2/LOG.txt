* 3.97 - 2017/02/12
- Fixed bug where AUCstats would report inverted values when the order of 
  labels was different than in template (introduced in V3.94 and acci-
  dentally not fixed in 3.95)
- Added AUCstats_matrix and AUCstats_pairwise for AUC with more than two 
  classes (all pairwise comparisons reported in a matrix or averaged) 
- Replaces strsplit with regexp to reintroduce backward compatibility to 
  at least R2009a.
- Added additional checks and minor fixes.

* 3.96 - 2016/12/10
- Fixed small bug in make_design_cv that wouldn't allow using sets under 
  all conditions
- Fixed bug that prevented use of multiple models in transers_SVM_pattern
- Added smaller utilities

* 3.95 - 2016/08/25
- Allow using kernel classification for output SVM_pattern

* 3.94 - 2016/08/22
- Allow using kernel classification for output SVM_weights
- Order of weights and decision values as outputs now not dependent on 
  order of labels in input (e.g. [3 1 2 5 4]), but now invariantly sorted 
  by label (e.g. [1 2 3 4 5]) -> affects transres_SVM_ functions as well 
  as libsvm_test and correlation_classifier
- Removed bug in SPM5 and SPM8 functions with double &&
- other small fixes

* 3.93 - 2016/08/04
- Prevalence Inference added. For details, see

      second-level t-test to prevalence inference. NeuroImage.

- Added support for reading 4D data (e.g. 4D nifti files)

* 3.52 - 2015/12/11
- Minor: changed coding in cfg.results.write. Now write = 1 writes both img 
  and mat file, and = 2 writes mat-file only [default: write = 1].

* 3.51 - 2015/11/05
- Added ensemble classification method for balancing of unbalanced data 
  and for balancing confounds
- demos run again (tiny and uncritical bug)
- minor improvement in visualisation functions

* 3.50 - 2015/10/01
- introduced similarity analysis
- updated license file
- other bugfixes

* 3.30 - 2015/07/22
- Added misc as new input (currently only for passing residuals)
- Allow scaling of each chunk separately
- Allow scaling using covariance of residuals
- New function decoding_load_misc to load e.g. residuals

* 3.10 - 2015/07/07
- introduced possibility to use multi-mask (multiple ROI masks in one file, indexed by integers)
- will also write as one file if one mask file is provided
- adapted decoding_load_data.m, load_mask.m, decoding_write_results.m and get_n_decodings.m for that purpose
- removed unneccessary if-clause in decoding.m
- added info to template scripts and tutorial
- updated license file.

* 3.06 - 2015/05/07
- Added a check for unbalanced test data.

* 3.04 - 2015/04/14
- Updated decoding_tutorial and FAQ.txt and added a missing function for 
passing data without classification.

* 3.03 - 2015/03/02
- Introduced LDA as additional classifier and graphical user interface.

* 3.01 - 2015/01/09
- Official version accompanying our accepted PAPER!

(TDT): A versatile software package for multivariate analyses of functional

* Martin N Hebart and Kai Goergen contributed equally to this work.

This version is equivalent to 3.0 that was available to the reviewers except for very minor modifications.

Major changes to previous version:
- The main toolbox folder has been renamed from
     decoding_betaversion/
  to
     decoding_toolbox/
  because we do not really consider the toolbox as beta anymore
  For backward compatibility reasons, you might simply add a symbolic link 
  "decoding_betaversion" that points to "decoding_toolbox". This should work.
- A LOT OF OTHER COOL STUFF (e.g. some statistics were added)


***** END OF OFFICIAL BETA PHASE *****


* beta 2.7 - 2014/07/14
- results stored in .mat now always reported as struct
- introduced feature_transformation as additional step that can be carried 
 out (e.g. for dimensionality reduction or other approaches)
- allow several levels of feature selection in one decoding (e.g. first 
 filter and then recursive feature elimination
- made parameter selection general purpose. Caveat: No downwards 
 compatibility for existing scripts (now enter '-c' instead of 'c' for 
 selecting parameters). Downwards compatibility not useful!
- replaced 'useall'-option in feature selection with 'estimation' (default 
in other methods, better comparability
- debugged feature selection
- completely rewrote decoding_write_results to allow writing any results 
  as image and writing searchlight results as .mat (plus fixed a few bugs on the way)
- filedetails.txt and cfg.mat: now not named after first output, but just named res_
- allow to pass flag that training and test data can be non-independent (e.g. for illustrative results of weights)
- added possibility to calculate patterns
- added balanced_accuracy
- and quite a bit more


* beta 2.6 - 2014/01/07
- Changed cfg.files.step to cfg.files.chunk, because steps (i.e. decoding
iterations, e.g. cross-validation steps) can be different from chunks
(i.e. data that should be kept together when cross-validation is performed)
- Resolved bug of truncated warnings

* beta 2.5 - 2013/06/19
Lots of things added, including
- automatic visualisation of design matrix and saving as image to results
- real-time plot of selected voxels
- more checks for potential errors
- feature selection working
- and many more

* beta 2.2 - some time in the past
Stable version of 2.1, but still has 2.1 as number displayed when starting
Widely used last stable version before starting this log
